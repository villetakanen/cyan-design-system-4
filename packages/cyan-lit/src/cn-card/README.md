## CSS Custom Properties

The card component uses CSS custom properties for theming:

- `--cn-card-background`: Card background color
- `--cn-card-box-shadow`: Card shadow
- `--cn-border-radius-card`: Card border radius
- `--_cn-card-title-color`: Override for title color

## Accessibility

- Card titles are properly structured using `h4` elements
- Cover images have empty alt attributes as they are decorative
- Icons use the `cn-icon` component which includes proper accessibility attributes
- When cards are linked, the link relationship is clear through the href attribute
