# Production Editor Freeze Fix - October 10, 2025

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Memory Leak - Focus Event Listener** (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: The focus event listener was never properly removed, causing multiple listeners to accumulate and potentially freeze the editor.

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
constructor() {
  // Creates NEW bound function each time
  this.addEventListener('focus', this._handleHostFocus.bind(this));
}

disconnectedCallback() {
  // Tries to remove different function reference - NEVER REMOVES IT!
  this.removeEventListener('focus', this._handleHostFocus);
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Every time a component is disconnected and reconnected (navigation, hot reload, etc.), a new event listener piles up
- Multiple listeners firing simultaneously causes race conditions
- Rapid focus events with multiple handlers can freeze the browser
- Production environments with long sessions accumulate many orphaned listeners

**Fix**:
```typescript
private _boundHandleHostFocus?: (event: FocusEvent) => void;

constructor() {
  this._boundHandleHostFocus = this._handleHostFocus.bind(this);
  this.addEventListener('focus', this._boundHandleHostFocus);
}

disconnectedCallback() {
  if (this._boundHandleHostFocus) {
    this.removeEventListener('focus', this._boundHandleHostFocus);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Focus Delegation Flag Stuck Forever** (HIGH)

**Problem**: If `_editorView.focus()` throws an error or is interrupted, the `_isDelegatingFocus` flag stays `true` forever, blocking all future focus attempts.

```typescript
// BEFORE:
this._isDelegatingFocus = true;
this._editorView.focus(); // If this throws, flag stays true!
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  this._isDelegatingFocus = false;
});
```

**Impact**:
- After one failed focus attempt, editor becomes permanently unfocusable
- User sees cursor but cannot type
- No error messages to indicate the problem
- Requires page refresh to recover

**Fix**:
```typescript
this._isDelegatingFocus = true;

// Clear any existing timeout
if (this._focusDelegationTimeout) {
  window.clearTimeout(this._focusDelegationTimeout);
}

// Safety: Force-reset flag after 500ms to prevent permanent lock
this._focusDelegationTimeout = window.setTimeout(() => {
  if (this._isDelegatingFocus) {
    console.warn('[CN-EDITOR] Focus delegation timeout - forcing reset');
    this._isDelegatingFocus = false;
  }
  this._focusDelegationTimeout = undefined;
}, 500);

try {
  this._editorView.focus();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[CN-EDITOR] Error during focus delegation:', error);
  this._isDelegatingFocus = false;
  if (this._focusDelegationTimeout) {
    window.clearTimeout(this._focusDelegationTimeout);
    this._focusDelegationTimeout = undefined;
  }
  return;
}

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  this._isDelegatingFocus = false;
  if (this._focusDelegationTimeout) {
    window.clearTimeout(this._focusDelegationTimeout);
    this._focusDelegationTimeout = undefined;
  }
});
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Production Freeze Scenario

1. User navigates between pages with editors (e.g., thread list → create thread → thread list)
2. Each navigation adds orphaned focus event listeners
3. After 10-20 page navigations, there are 10-20 duplicate listeners
4. User focuses an editor
5. All 10-20 listeners fire simultaneously
6. Multiple `requestAnimationFrame` calls queue up
7. Focus delegation flag gets set/unset in rapid succession (race condition)
8. CodeMirror receives multiple focus commands while processing input
9. CodeMirror's event loop gets overwhelmed
10. Browser freezes trying to process the queue

### Why Paste Worked But Typing Didn't

- Paste uses `navigator.clipboard` API (separate code path)
- Typing requires CodeMirror's keymap extensions to process events
- If contentDOM doesn't have focus OR focus flag is stuck, keymaps never receive events
- Paste operations bypass the keymap system entirely

## Files Changed

- `/packages/cn-editor/src/cn-editor.ts`

## Changes Made

1. ✅ Added `_boundHandleHostFocus` property to store bound function reference
2. ✅ Updated constructor to store and use bound reference
3. ✅ Updated disconnectedCallback to properly remove listener
4. ✅ Added `_focusDelegationTimeout` safety timeout
5. ✅ Added try-catch around focus delegation with cleanup
6. ✅ Added timeout cleanup in disconnectedCallback

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
```bash
cd packages/cn-editor
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

### Manual Testing
Open `test-autofocus-bug.html` in browser:
1. Refresh page multiple times (simulate navigation)
2. Try typing immediately after page load
3. Open console and run: `document.querySelector('cn-editor').checkEditorHealth()`
4. Verify no memory leaks in Chrome DevTools (Performance → Memory)

### Production Validation

**Before deploying**:
1. Test in staging environment with realistic usage patterns
2. Navigate between pages 20+ times
3. Create multiple threads/comments
4. Check browser memory usage doesn't grow unbounded

**After deploying**:
1. Monitor for error logs: `[CN-EDITOR] Focus delegation timeout`
2. Monitor for error logs: `[CN-EDITOR] Error during focus delegation`
3. Check user reports of typing issues
4. Monitor browser performance metrics

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] Build successful
- [ ] Local testing completed
- [ ] Memory leak testing completed
- [ ] Staging deployment
- [ ] Production testing (small user group)
- [ ] Full production deployment
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Update PBI beta.008 with results

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate
- No more frozen editors in production
- Memory usage stays constant across page navigations
- All focus events properly cleaned up

### Long-term
- Stable editor performance even in long sessions
- No user reports of "cursor visible but can't type"
- Reduced browser memory usage

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert to version 4.0.0-beta.17
2. Add more diagnostic logging
3. Create reproduction case in test environment
4. Investigate CodeMirror internal state

## Related Issues

- PBI beta.008: Original autofocus keystroke bug
- PBI beta.001: Previous form integration issues
- Related to: Shadow DOM focus delegation patterns

## Version

This fix should be released as **4.0.0-beta.18**
