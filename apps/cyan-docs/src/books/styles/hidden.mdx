# Visibility Atomics

A set of atomic classes to control the visibility of elements based on screen size. These are useful for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different devices.

## Hiding elements

You can hide elements on specific screen sizes using the `.sm-hidden`, `.md-hidden`, and `.lg-hidden` classes.

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.sm-hidden` | Hides the element on small screens (up to 620px). |
| `.md-hidden` | Hides the element on medium screens (961px to 1364px). |
| `.lg-hidden` | Hides the element on large screens (1365px and up). |

```html
<div class="sm-hidden">
  This element is hidden on small screens.
</div>
<div class="md-hidden">
  This element is hidden on medium screens.
</div>
<div class="lg-hidden">
  This element is hidden on large screens.
</div>
```

<h3>Live example</h3>
<div class="flex three-col">
  <div class="surface sm-hidden"><p>Hidden on small screens</p></div>
  <div class="surface md-hidden"><p>Hidden on medium screens</p></div>
  <div class="surface lg-hidden"><p>Hidden on large screens</p></div>
</div>

## Showing elements on specific screen sizes

You can also show elements only on specific screen sizes using the `.sm-only`, `.md-only`, and `.lg-only` classes.

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.sm-only` | Shows the element only on small screens. |
| `.md-only` | Shows the element only on medium screens. |
| `.lg-only` | Shows the element only on large screens. |

```html
<div class="sm-only">
  This element is only visible on small screens.
</div>
<div class="md-only">
  This element is only visible on medium screens.
</div>
<div class="lg-only">
  This element is only visible on large screens.
</div>
```

<h3>Live example</h3>
<div class="flex three-col">
  <div class="surface sm-only"><p>Only on small screens</p></div>
  <div class="surface md-only"><p>Only on medium screens</p></div>
  <div class="surface lg-only"><p>Only on large screens</p></div>
</div>

## Screen reader only

The `.screen-reader-only` class hides an element visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers. This is useful for providing additional context to visually impaired users.

```html
<a href="/login">
  Login
  <span class="screen-reader-only">(opens a new page)</span>
</a>
```
