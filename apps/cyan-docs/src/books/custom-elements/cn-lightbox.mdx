# cn-lightbox

The `cn-lightbox` component is a LitElement that provides a flexible and stylish way to display one or more images. It can render a single large image with a caption or a scrollable gallery of images, each with its own caption.

## Usage

To use the `cn-lightbox`, you need to provide an array of image objects to its `images` property. Each object should contain a `src` (the image URL) and a `caption`.

### Single Image

When a single image is provided, it is displayed prominently within the component's bounds.

### Multiple Images

When multiple images are provided, they are displayed in a horizontal, scrollable list. Each image is displayed as a square, preserving its aspect ratio within the gallery.

## Examples

Here are some live examples of the `cn-lightbox` component:
