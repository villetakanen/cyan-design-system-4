# Content Layouts

We provide two main layout utility classes: `content-columns` and `content-cards`. Both of these 
support `article`, `section`, `header`, `footer` and `cn-card` elements as children, and will apply 
appropriate styles to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.

## Content Columns

The content columns layout is designed to display content in a multi-column format, akin to a magazine layout. It is ideal for displaying articles, blog posts, or any content that benefits from a structured, columnar format.

We support 3 column sizes: `column-l`, `column-m`, and `column-s`, for large, medium, and small columns respectively. Omitting the class will default to `column-m`.

## Example Usage

The three columns here are children of the `content-columns` class, which applies the necessary styles to create a responsive layout. The columnn widhts are defined by the `column-l`, `[column-m]`, and `column-s`, in that order.

## Content Cards

  </header>
  <cn-card title="Card 1" noun="card">
    This is the first card in the content cards layout.
  </cn-card>
  <cn-card title="Card 2" noun="card" cover="/path/to/image.jpg">
    This card has a cover image and is part of the content cards layout.
  </cn-card>
  <cn-card title="Card 3" noun="card" elevation="2">
    This is the third card, demonstrating the content cards layout.
  </cn-card>
  <footer>
    This is an example of the cards-layout. It's primarily aimed for displauying cards in a grid-like format, where each card can contain various types of content. Any other sections and articles will be treated as "virtual" cards, and will be displayed in the same grid format.
