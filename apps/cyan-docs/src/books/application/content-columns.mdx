<h1 class="text-h2">Content: Columns</h1>

The original content area container "columns" â€“ aka `div.content-columns` is a flexible 
layout component that allows for the arrangement of content in a multi-column format. 
It is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, providing a 
responsive and user-friendly experience.

Where the main-area of the application is wide enough, we support 3 column sizes: 
`column-s`, `column-m`, and `column-l`. The column sizes are defined by the 
CSS variables `--cn-width-column-s`, `--cn-width-column-m`, and `--cn-width-column-l`. 
If a direct descendant of the `div.content-columns` does not have a defined column size,
it will default to `column-m`.

In contrast to the earlier versions of the Design System, we assume that the container
element is a div, with sections and articles as direct children. This division of semantic
structure is not enforced strictly, but it's safe to assume that it might be in future
revisions of the Design System.

## Breakpoints and sizing

The `.content-columns` container has two modes: 

1. **Default mode**: This is the standard multi-column layout, which applies when the main app container (most likely `<main>`) is wider than 760px.
2. **Single column mode**: This mode is activated when the viewport is narrower than 760px, stacking the columns on top of each other for better readability.

### Column widths

In the default mode, the column widths are derived from the golden ratio, creating a visually appealing layout. 
The specific widths are as follows:

| Column Size | Token  | Default size |
|-------------|--------|---|
| `column-s`  | `34 * var(--cn-grid)`  | `272px` |
| `[column-m]`  | `55 * var(--cn-grid)`  | `440px`  |
| `column-l`  | `88 * var(--cn-grid)`  | `704px`  |

In single column mode, all columns stack on top of each other, taking the full width of the container.
