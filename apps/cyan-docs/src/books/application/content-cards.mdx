# Content: Cards

The `.content-cards` container is used to group together card-like content blocks in a responsive layout.

The content area supports 3 types of content:
1. The header, including any `.toolbar`'s for filters, actions etc.
2. The main content area, where the card listing is displayed.
3. The footer, for any additional information or actions related to the cards.

(Note: all of this info is inside the header)

<div class="toolbar">
  <p class="grow">A toolbar can be added to the header.</p>
  <button>Filter</button>
  <button>Sort</button>
</div>
</header>

<cn-card

  <p class="text-small">
    The main area of the content grid allows 3 columns of cards to be displayed.
  </p>
</cn-card>

<section class="surface elevation-2">

### Card-likes?

We also support `<section>` and `<article>` elements as card-like containers. These elements can be used to create 
a more semantic structure for your content, displayed in a content grid like cards would.

<cn-card

  <p class="text-small">
    The `.content-cards` breaks at main app area container < 720px and switches from a grid layout layout to a vertical single-column flexbox.
  </p>
</cn-card>

<article class="border">
  <h4>Support for various elements</h4>

  <p>The articles and sections can contain any content, just as the content-columns could.</p>

  <p class="text-low text-small">
    F.ex. this article does not have `.surface` styling applied, and still works with the content grid.
  </p>
</article>

<footer>

### The footer?

We also support footer in the same manner that we support the header.
